    "## Notes on Recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "A [recursive function](https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_function_recursion.asp) is one which calls itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When the function is called, your CPU runs through each line of code until the function needs to be called again.\n",
    "2. At that point, all variables are saved in memory, and the function runs through each line of code again until the function is called (again, but with a different passed argument), and so on.\n",
    "3. Eventually, this process will stop at the \"bottom of the **stack**\", where the function doesn't get a chance to call itself again (likely because of some condition un/met by the latest passed argument).\n",
    "4. Then, your CPU will work its way back up the stack to the final result. For example, take a look at [this visual example](https://realpython.com/python-recursion/#calculate-factorial) of calculating 4!.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you write these functions, keep two things in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will need a built-in stopping point (i.e., the \"bottom\"), where your function returns some result before it calls itself.\n",
    "- **Don't think too hard about this.** Recursion can be perplexing to conceptualize when writing the code. So, when you call the function inside the function, think about it as a magical \"hidden\" function that has already done what you want it to do.\n",
    "- [Python Tutor](https://pythontutor.com/) ([editor](https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit)) can be a helpful resource for this exercise!\n",
